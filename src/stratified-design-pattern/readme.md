### What is Stratified Design?
- A design technique for building software in layers.
- Each layer defines new functions in terms of functions in the layers below it.
  
#### Patterns of stratified design
1. straightforward implementation:
    - When we read a function with a straightforward implementation, the problem the function signature presents should be solved at the right level of detail in the body.
    - Too much detail is a code smell

2. Abstract barrier:
    - Some layers in the graph provide an interface that lets us hide an important implementation detail.
    - These layers help us write code at a higher level and free our limited mental capacity to think at a higher level.

3. Minimal interface:
    - As our system evolves, we want the interfaces to important business concepts to converge to a small, powerful set of operations.
    - Every other operation should be defined in terms of those, either directly or indirectly.

4. Comfortable layers:
    - The code and its layers of abstraction should feel comfortable to work in.

- To understand identify layers in our design, identifying inputs/outputs is very important
- These inputs/outputs will be used as clues to help in classifying the our functions:

##### inputs
- Function Bodies:
    - Length
    - Complexity
    - Levels of detail
    - Functions called
    - Language features used
- Layer structure:
    - Arrow length
    - Cohesion
    - Level of detail
- Functional signatures:
    - Function names
    - Argument names
    - Argument values
    - Return value

##### Outputs
- Organization:
    - Decide where a new function goes
    - Move functions around
- Implementation:
    - Change an implementation
    - Extract a function
    - changes in a data structure
- Changes:
    - Choose where the new code is written
    - Decide what level of detail is appropriate

##### There are many reasons to keep the abstraction barrier minimal:
1. If we add more code to the barrier, we have more to change when we change the implementation.
2. Code in the barrier is lower level, so itâ€™s more likely to contain bugs.
3. Low-level code is harder to understand.
4. More functions in an abstraction barrier mean more coordination between teams.
5. A larger interface to our abstraction barrier is harder to keep in your head.
